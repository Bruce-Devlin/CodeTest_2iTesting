# CodeTest_i2Testing
Welcome to te Code test made for i2 Testing created by Bruce Devlin.

##This challenge that was set:
"provide code that iterates in multiples of A until X, then in multiples of A + 1 until 2X, then multiples of A + 2 until 3X"

##A better understanding of the problem:
"The code should allow for the input of 2 numbers, Value 1 (A) and Value 2 (X). My interptritation of the issue is that
the code must take Value 1 and multiply it by itself until the number reaches Value 2 then, it will multiply Value 1 plus 1 
until 2 followed by Value 2 and finally Value 1 plus 2 until 3 followed by Value 2.

To do this I will iterate using a for loop multiplying Value 1 (initialValue) by Value 2 (maxValue), then I will repeat this loop 
for handling the addition.

My code will sometimes exceed Value 2 as it gets to the closest value to X.

The application also accepts arguments to multiply the values (seperated by a space.)
